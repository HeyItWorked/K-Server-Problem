# K-Server-Problem
- A project research paper in Online Algorithm course. The topic is on surverying conjectures of the problems with relation to subset problems relating to k-Server
- A simpler version of k-Server is the Paging Problem, which has real life application in virtual memory management utilized by operating systems
- The problem lies in the domain of Online Algorithm, vital to theory of Competitive Analysis
- The survey aims to circle down to the most effective competitive algorithm in hope of closing to k-competitive bound
- Performance is researched against various frameworks of adversary
